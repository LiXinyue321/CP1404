1, Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks,
 how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
> I predicted the time required for each Python script and then recorded the actual completion time. 
> While I believe my predictions were fairly on point, I did notice a marked improvement in my accuracy as the subject went on, especially in avoiding redundant "repetition."
2, Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
> I've come to realize that absent comments can sometimes leave even the original coders puzzled during reviews. 
> It highlighted the crucial role of detailed commenting in code.
3, Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
> I'd largely keep the practical tasks as they are. 
> That said, I'd suggest incorporating illustrative outputs for each topic and offering solutions for every task to aid understanding.
